# Hi there,

My name is Dominic.  I live in Boulder, Colorado.  In my spare time I
enjoy climbing and hiking (off-widths are the best; the Voo, Lumpy, and
S'Platte rule).  Besides that I'm interested in most anything related to
physics, software, software engineering, high performance computing, and
computers in general.  Coming up with efficient implementations of cool
algorithms relevant for scientific computation is what I enjoy the most.
My background is in quantum physics, laser physics, and quantum optics.
